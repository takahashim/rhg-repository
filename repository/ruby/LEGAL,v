* string.c (get_pat): quote metachracters before compiling a
  string into a regex.

    A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/2/10.
    Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
    This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus's optimization,
    Matthe Bellew's simplification, Isaku Wada's real version.

    Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed) 
    or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).

@Import the "digest" module and the submodules, from the Rough Ruby
project.

  ext/digest:
    This module provides the module Digest and the abstract class
    Digest::Base.

  ext/digest/md5 (which obsoletes ext/md5):
    This module provides the class Digest::MD5 which implements the
    MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm.

  ext/digest/rmd160:
    This module provides the class Digest::RMD160 which implements the
    RIPEMD-160 cryptographic hash function.

  ext/digest/sha1 (which obsoletes ext/sha1):
    This module provides the class Digest::SHA1 which implements the
    SHA-1 Secure Hash Algorithm.

  ext/digest/sha2:
    This module provides the classes Digest::SHA256, Digest::SHA384
    and Digest::SHA512 which implement the SHA-256, SHA-384 and
    SHA-512 Secure Hash Algorithms, respectively.

  lib/md5.rb, lib/sha1.rb:
    These files are provided for backward compatibility.

All these classes have the common API, which previously ext/md5 and
ext/sha1 modules provided.  While the new API keeps 100% backward
compatibility, it has been enriched with several utility methods.
