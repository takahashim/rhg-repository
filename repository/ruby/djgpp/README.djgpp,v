@* How to compile and install on djgpp

This is what you need to do to compile and install Ruby:

  1. Run configure.bat, which will generate config.h and Makefile
     (GNU sed required).
     Message like this is normal:
       sed.exe: can't read 123456789: No such file or directory (ENOENT)

  2. Edit defines.h if you need.  Probably this step will not need.

  3. Remove comment mark(#) before the module names from ext/Setup.dj (or
     add module names if not present).

  4. Run make.

  5. Optionally, run 'make test' to check whether the compiled Ruby
     interpreter works well.  If you see the message "test succeeded",
     your ruby works as it should (hopefully).

  6. Run 'make install'
