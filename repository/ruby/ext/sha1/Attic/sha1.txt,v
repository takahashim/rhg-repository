@Import the "digest" module and the submodules, from the Rough Ruby
project.

  ext/digest:
    This module provides the module Digest and the abstract class
    Digest::Base.

  ext/digest/md5 (which obsoletes ext/md5):
    This module provides the class Digest::MD5 which implements the
    MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm.

  ext/digest/rmd160:
    This module provides the class Digest::RMD160 which implements the
    RIPEMD-160 cryptographic hash function.

  ext/digest/sha1 (which obsoletes ext/sha1):
    This module provides the class Digest::SHA1 which implements the
    SHA-1 Secure Hash Algorithm.

  ext/digest/sha2:
    This module provides the classes Digest::SHA256, Digest::SHA384
    and Digest::SHA512 which implement the SHA-256, SHA-384 and
    SHA-512 Secure Hash Algorithms, respectively.

  lib/md5.rb, lib/sha1.rb:
    These files are provided for backward compatibility.

All these classes have the common API, which previously ext/md5 and
ext/sha1 modules provided.  While the new API keeps 100% backward
compatibility, it has been enriched with several utility methods.

Read digest.txt for further details.

** SHA1(Class)

A class to implement the SHA1 Secure Hash Algorithm by NIST (the US'
National Institute of Standards and Technology), described in FIPS PUB
180-1.

Superclass: Object

Class Methods:

   new([str])
   sha1([str])

	Creates a new SHA1 object.  If a string argument is given, it
        is added to the object. (see update.)

Methods:

   clone

	Copies the SHA1 object.

   digest

	Returns the SHA1 hash of the added strings as a string of 20
	bytes.

   hexdigest

	Returns the SHA1 hash of the added strings as a string of 40
	hexadecimal digits.  This method is equal to:

	def hexdigest
	  ret = ''
	  digest.each_byte {|i| ret << sprintf('%02x', i) }
	  ret
	end

   update(str)
   << str

	Updates the SHA1 object with string str.  Repeated calls are
	equivalent to a single call with the concatenation of all the
	arguments, i.e. m.update(a); m.update(b) is equivalent to
	m.update(a+b) and m << a << b is equivalent to m << a+b.
