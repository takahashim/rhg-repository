== Overview

Apache::RD2HTML converts RD to HTML.

== Requirements

* RDtool 0.6.7 or later.

== Example of httpd.conf

  RubyRequire apache/rd2html
  Alias /ruby-lib-doc/ /usr/lib/ruby/1.6/
  <Location /ruby-lib-doc>
  Options Indexes
  SetHandler ruby-object
  RubyHandler Apache::RD2HTML.instance
  </Location>

You can see the HTML version of ruby library documents at
<URL:http://your.host.name/ruby-lib-doc/>.
If there are no RD documents in a script, mod_rd2html returns
"415 Unsupported Media Type".
