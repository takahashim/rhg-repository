== Overview

Apache::RubyRun executes Ruby scripts.

== Example of httpd.conf

  RubyRequire apache/ruby-run
  <Location /ruby>
  SetHandler ruby-object
  RubyHandler Apache::RubyRun.instance
  </Location>

=end

require "singleton"

module Apache
  class RubyRun
    include Singleton

    def handler(r)
      if r.method_number == M_OPTIONS
	r.allowed |= (1 << M_GET)
	r.allowed |= (1 << M_POST)
	return DECLINED
      end
      if r.finfo.mode == 0
	return NOT_FOUND
      end
      if r.allow_options & OPT_EXECCGI == 0
	r.log_reason("Options ExecCGI is off in this directory", r.filename)
	return FORBIDDEN
      end
      unless r.finfo.executable?
	r.log_reason("file permissions deny server execution", r.filename)
	return FORBIDDEN
      end
      r.setup_cgi_env

      filename.untaint
      Apache.chdir_file(filename)
